## Ingredients:







  * Saamai - 1.25 cups
  * Paasi paruppu / Moong dhal - 3/4 cup
  * Ginger - Few pieces
  * A pinch of turmeric
  * Water - 2.5 cups for every cup of Saamai
  * Salt






## **To Temper**:







  * Jeera - 2 tbsp
  * Pepper corns - 2 tbsp
  * Curry leaves
  * Ghee - 3tbs






## **Preparation**:







Dry roast the Moong dhal. Take care to ensure that it does not turn brown. Roast until the aroma of Moong dhal starts coming.

In a pressure cooker, add chopped Ginger, Saamai, roasted Moong dhal, Turmeric, Salt and Water. Be generous in adding water, so that you will get soft Pongal. Pressure cook it for 4 whistles.







After the pressure gets released, open the lid and temper with ingredients listed under the "_To Temper_" section and mix well. Add more ghee if you wish. If you want spicy Pongal, dry roast Jeera and Pepper corns and make it into a powder and mix it with the Pongal.
